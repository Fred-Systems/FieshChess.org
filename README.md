🐟 FieshChess V8.0

1-The Ultimate Browser-Based Chess Analysis Suite
FieshChess is a high-performance analysis platform built for the modern chess enthusiast. By merging elite-level engine evaluation with seamless third-party integrations, FieshChess provides a professional-grade environment for game review and study.

2-Credits & Acknowledgments
  FieshChess is built upon the incredible work of the open-source chess community. We would like to credit the following APIs and engines that make this     project possible:

  Stockfish Engine: Powerful, world-class evaluation provided via the Stockfish.js project.

  Chess.com API: Used for real-time player profile data and match history retrieval.

  Lichess Explorer API: Powering our opening theory and master game database.

  Chess.js: Handling move validation and PGN logic.

  Firebase: Providing secure cloud authentication and infrastructure.


3-How to Use: Dynamic Commentary
  One of FieshChess's most unique features is the Dual-Personality Commentary System. You can have grandmaster-level insights delivered in the style of      your favorite chess personalities.

  Select Your Personalities: Navigate to the Commentary Settings. You can enable up to two distinct personalities simultaneously.

  Interactive Dialogue: Even when playing against the engine or analyzing a local game, both personalities will weigh in on the position, offering          contrasting advice or stylistic flair.

  Customization: Choose which colors you want the commentators to focus on. You can set one personality to analyze White's best chances while the other      critiques Black's mistakes.

4-Current Development Status
  FieshProductions is committed to continuous improvement. Please note the following features are currently in active development:

  Cloud Save & Load Integration: While Google Authentication is active, the dedicated "Load Game" UI is currently being finalized. Your games are being      saved to the cloud, and the full loading interface will be available in the next update.

  Mobile Optimization: We are currently refining the mobile-responsive layout. While the app is functional on mobile browsers, we are working on a           edicated touch-optimized experience to ensure seamless play on smaller screens.
